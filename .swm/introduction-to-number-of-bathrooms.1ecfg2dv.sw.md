# Definition

# Introduction

The number of bathrooms, referred to as 'Baths', is an important attribute in real estate listings. This information is essential for potential buyers or renters as it helps them understand the amenities available in the property.

The Baths field is defined as a custom field in the Property object. It is a numeric field with a precision of 2, indicating that it can store numbers with up to two decimal places. This field is not required, meaning that it can be left empty if the information is not available. It is also not unique, allowing multiple properties to have the same number of bathrooms.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<CustomField xmlns="http://soap.sforce.com/2006/04/metadata">
    <fullName>Baths__c</fullName>
    <externalId>false</externalId>
    <label>Baths</label>
    <precision>2</precision>
    <required>false</required>
    <scale>0</scale>
    <trackFeedHistory>false</trackFeedHistory>
    <trackHistory>false</trackHistory>
    <trackTrending>false</trackTrending>
    <type>Number</type>
    <unique>false</unique>
</CustomField>

# Usage

The Baths field is used in various components to display the number of bathrooms in a property. For example, in the `propertyListMap` component, it is displayed alongside the number of beds.

```javascript
    <p>Beds: ${property.Beds__c} - Baths: ${property.Baths__c}</p>
```
