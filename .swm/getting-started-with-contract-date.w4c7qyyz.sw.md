## Purpose of Date Contracted

# Getting Started with Contract Date

Date Contracted refers to the specific date when a property contract is signed or agreed upon.

## Characteristics of Date Contracted

This field is used to track the date on which the property contract becomes effective.

## Example of Date Contracted

It is a custom field in the Property object and is not required, meaning it can be left empty if the date is not available. The field type is Date, which ensures that only date values can be entered.
