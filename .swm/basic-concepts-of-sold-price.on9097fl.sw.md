Price Sold refers to the final selling price of a property. It is a custom field in the Property Management system.

This field is defined with a precision of 8 and a scale of 0, indicating it is a currency type without decimal places.

The field is not required, meaning it can be left empty if the property has not been sold yet.

Price Sold is used in the Property Management system to record the final selling price of a property.
