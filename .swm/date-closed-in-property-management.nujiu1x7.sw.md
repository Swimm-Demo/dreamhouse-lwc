# What is Date Closed

Date Closed refers to the specific date when a property transaction is finalized and officially closed. This field is essential for tracking the completion of property deals and ensuring that all related processes are concluded.

The Date Closed field is a custom field within the Property Management system, specifically designed to store the closing date of a property. This field is not mandatory, meaning it can be left empty if the closing date is not yet determined.
