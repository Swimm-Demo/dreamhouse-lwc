# Integrations Overview

Integrations refer to the connections between the Dreamhouse application and external services or platforms. These integrations enable the application to leverage external data and functionalities, enhancing its capabilities.

For example, the `cspTrustedSites` directory contains configurations for trusted sites, allowing the application to securely interact with external resources.

Additionally, the `messageChannels` directory includes message channels that facilitate communication between different parts of the application and external services.
